# Event Management

## Digital Agenda

Our university hosts numerous large-scale events throughout the admissions cycle to encourage students to take the next step towards their enrollment. These events typically feature concurrent sessions involving various campus partners beyond the admissions department.

To effectively capture event data, we use a master event template with related event widgets. Students select these widgets during registration, providing essential information for generating customized and personalized agendas. Post registration, this interactive agenda is sent to the registrants and their guests via event communications.

While pre-registration values populate the agenda, several key considerations arise when designing the event portals:
* Session support: What crucial information must be readily available to support each session?
* Guest access: How can we provide agendas for both registrants and their guests?
* Mobile-friendliness: How can we ensure seamless mobile access?
